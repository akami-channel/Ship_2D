I'm putting everything in this proj directory because I have this other repo called shipbuilder that is supposed to build ship_2D. That might be useful, for example, if I want to have extensions that can be added or not at will. The idea is that everything in proj can be examined with a checksum and I can test what shipbuilder builds against the ship_2D checksum. That way I can make automated tests.
